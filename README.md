# Gaum - Groups And User Management

Gaum is a shell script created in bash 5.1. The purpose of this script is to facilitate the creation of groups and users in Linux. Also how to add these last ones to different groups in a massive way.

It's recommended to use only in linux because it has not been tested outside this environment so its behavior is unpredictable.
